# Handling Optional Values in Swift Calculations
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Swift programming involving optional values and calculations.  Optional values can lead to unexpected `nil` results if not handled correctly.  The code shows how to use optionals safely, preventing crashes and ensuring accurate calculations.

## Problem
When working with functions that might return `nil`, using optionals is essential to prevent runtime errors.  However, if not handled properly, these optionals can cause unexpected `nil` results even if input values are valid.  This is particularly problematic in calculation functions.

## Solution
The solution involves safely unwrapping optional values using techniques like optional binding (`guard let`) or the nil-coalescing operator (`??`). These ensure that calculation functions gracefully handle scenarios where one or more input values might be `nil`.  This prevents unexpected crashes and produces more predictable and robust results.
